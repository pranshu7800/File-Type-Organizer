# File-Type-Organizer
I created a CLI command with the help of Node.js where a directory is messed up different types files and we want to organize or store these files into the folder/directory of their types with one go and a tree command with the help of this a tree like structure of the files and folder were shown. I used modules like path, file system(fs) and with the help of shebang we can run the command globally into our command prompt.
